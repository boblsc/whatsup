# ArXiv Configuration
arxiv:
  # List of arXiv categories to monitor
  # Examples: cond-mat.supr-con, physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM
  # Find categories at: https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy
  categories:
    - cond-mat.supr-con
    - physics.ins-det
    - astro-ph.IM
  
  # Keywords for pre-filtering (optional, improves speed)
  # Papers matching ANY keyword will be evaluated by LLM
  keywords:
    - superconductor
    - quasiparticle
    - THz
    - detector
    - photon
  
  # How many days back to search for papers
  max_days_back: 1

# OpenAI API Configuration
openai:
